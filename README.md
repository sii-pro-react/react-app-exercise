# React Bank application

Application made for learning purposes.

It's kind of a banking app with mocked data and basic CRUD functionality.

Running:

```
cd backend
npm i
cd ../frontend
npm i
npm run dev
```

Done on workshop:

1. Load data to the table
2. Remove functionality

To be done as homework :)

1. Is removable - add icon component
2. Add new column for modifying (with button)
3. Add modal and functionality for modifying
4. Add modal and functionality for adding new item
